          If we take a closer look at Bubble Sort algorithm, we can notice that
          in first pass, we move largest element to end (Assuming sorting in
          increasing order). In second pass, we move second largest element to
          second last position and so on. <br />
          1. Base Case: If array size is 1, return. <br />
          2. Do One Pass of normal Bubble Sort. This pass fixes last element of
          current subarray. <br />
          3. Recur for all elements except last of current subarray. <br />

          QuickSort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as
          pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot. There
          are many different versions of quickSort that pick pivot in different
          ways.
          <br />
          1. Always pick first element as pivot. <br />
          2. Always pick last element as pivot (implemented below) <br />
          3. Pick a random element as pivot. <br />
          4. Pick median as pivot. <br />
          The key process in quickSort is partition(). Target of partitions is,
          given an array and an element x of array as pivot, put x at its
          correct position in sorted array and put all smaller elements (smaller
          than x) before x, and put all greater elements (greater than x) after
          x. All this should be done in linear time. <br />

            There can be many ways to do partition. The logic is simple, we
            start from the leftmost element and keep track of index of smaller
            (or equal to) elements as i. While traversing, if we find a smaller
            element, we swap current element with arr[i]. Otherwise we ignore
            current element.

          efficiently implemented on most architectures, and in most real-world
          data. QuickSort can be implemented in different ways by changing the
          choice of pivot, so that the worst case rarely occurs for a given type
          of data. However, merge sort is generally considered better when data

          merging two halves. The merge(arr, left, middle, right) is key process

          <li>
            1. Merge Sort is useful for sorting linked lists in O(nLogn) time.In
            the case of linked lists, the case is different mainly due to the
            difference in memory allocation of arrays and linked lists.

            2. Inversion Count Problem: Inversion Count for an array indicates â€“
            how far (or close) the array is from being sorted. If array is
            already sorted then inversion count is 0. If array is sorted in
            reverse order that inversion count is the maximum.
          </li>
          <li>
            3. Used in External Sorting: External sorting is a class of sorting
            algorithms that can handle massive amounts of data. External sorting
            is required when the data being sorted do not fit into the main
            memory of a computing device (usually RAM) and instead they must
            reside in the slower external memory, usually a hard disk drive.
            Thus, external sorting algorithms are external memory algorithms and
            thus applicable in the external memory model of computation. (Wikipedia)
